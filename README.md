# Joomla Help Site

This application is the code powering the [help.joomla.org](https://help.joomla.org) website. Its purpose is to render the help screens used in the Joomla! CMS and display a landing page for the now retired version of this site.

## Requirements

* PHP 8.0+
* Composer
* Apache with mod_rewrite enabled and configured to allow the .htaccess file to be read
* If changing web assets, NPM is required

## Installation

1. Clone this repo on your web server
2. Run the `composer install` command to install all dependencies
3. Copy `etc/config.dist.json` to `etc/config.json` and configure your environment

## Modifying Web Assets

The web assets (CSS, JavaScript, and images) are compiled and processed with [Laravel Mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix) which is a wrapper around webpack. The primary source for all assets is the `assets` directory, running Mix will place production assets into the `www/media` directory.

The use of Mix requires [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) as hinted at in the Installation section.  NPM 6+ and Node 10+ are required.  Three scripts are available:

* `npm run prod` will compile assets for production, which includes compression and minification; code must be committed to this repository with the production configuration
* `npm run dev` will compile the assets without production optimizations
* `npm run watch` is the same as the `dev` script but with the `--watch` flag passed

This site makes use of [Subresource Integrity (SRI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity), therefore the integrity hashes must be regenerated after compiling assets. This can be done by running the `bin/console template:generate-sri` command.

## Additional Configuration

The application optionally supports several additional configuration values which affect the application's behavior, to include:

* Caching - The `symfony/cache` package is used to provide a caching API to store data. The supported configuration values are under the `cache` key in the configuration and include:
    * `enabled` - Is the cache enabled?
    * `lifetime` - The lifetime (in seconds) of the cache data
    * `adapter` - The cache adapter to use; the currently supported values can be found in the [CacheProvider](src/Service/CacheProvider.php)
    * `namespace` - A unique namespace (or key prefix) for the application's cache, useful if using a shared cache source with other systems
* Debug - The `system.debug` configuration key can be set to true or false to enable the application's debug mode
* Error Reporting - The `system.error_reporting` configuration key can be set to a valid bitmask to be passed into the `error_reporting()` function
* Logging - The application's logging levels can be fine tuned by adjusting the `log` configuration keys:
    * `log.level` - The default logging level to use for all application loggers
    * `log.application` - The logging level to use specifically for the `monolog.handler.application` logger; defaults to the `log.level` value
* Template - The `twig/twig` package is used for the application's templates
    * `template.debug` - Flag to enable Twig's debug functionality, when enabled the caching functionality is not available
    * `template.cache.enabled` - Flag to enable Twig's caching functionality, defaults to false
    * `template.cache.path` - The path relative to the repo root where cached Twig files should be stored, defaults to `cache/twig`
* Wiki Integration - Some behaviors for the remote MediaWiki integration can be configured with the following configuration keys:
    * `help.wiki` - The base URL of the MediaWiki instance to interface with, defaults to `https://docs.joomla.org`
    * `help.wiki_max_redirects` - The number of wiki page redirects that will be followed, defaults to 5
